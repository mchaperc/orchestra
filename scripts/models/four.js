						'Because I\'m so THUNDERSTRUCK by how amazing you are- the secret word is "THUNDERSTRUCK!" Tell Mrs. C during the next class and earn something extra special. :) (By the way, I hope you\'re a LOT nicer to your bows & instruments than these guys...) This group is called "2Cellos:" Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser are their names. They both went to college at two of the top music schools in the world and won many international music competitions- playing classical music! They\'ve played with Elton John, appeared on TV shows like the Tonight Show, GLEE, and Ellen Degeneres Show, among others. They are just as happy playing classical music as they are playing rock music.  Click here to check out their website!',
